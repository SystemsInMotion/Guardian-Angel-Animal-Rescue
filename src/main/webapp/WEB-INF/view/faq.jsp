	<p class="question first">What is a no-kill organization and is
		GAAR one of them?</p>

	<p class="answer">Yes, GAAR is a no-kill animal rescue. We do NOT
		euthanize animals due to lack of space, time, type of breed, or any
		other reason. Many foster parent have kept animals that are too sick
		to be adopted, such as a dog in its terminal stage of cancer. We will
		exhaust every effort to keep an animal alive.</p>

	<p class="question">How can I help?</p>

	<p class="answer">
		There are so many ways to help. Check out our&nbsp;<a
			href="http://www.gaarmichigan.org/volunteer/">Volunteer section</a>&nbsp;for
		all the different options.

	<p class="question">How long must I foster an animal before it is
		adopted?</p>

	<p class="answer">Unfortunately, there is no way of telling how
		long you may have the pet. The economy, the season and the community
		are all factors that affect the adoptability of an animal. If time is
		an issue, consider volunteering for us in a different way. Check the
		volunteer section or talk to us about it, we're happy to figure out
		how you can best help!</p>

	<p class="question">How can I donate?</p>

	<p class="question">I think I need to give up my cat. Is there
		anything I should consider?</p>

	<p class="answer">Older Adult Owner give ups are probably the
		worst: the cats come from a home where they were once loved and
		suddenly thrown into either a kill shelter or a overcrowded rescue.</p>
	<p>In a kill shelter they are treated like any other animal, no
		special treatment, most are so stressed that they do not pass the
		&ldquo;temperament test&rdquo;. &nbsp;We have seen perfectly loving
		sweet cats turn mean and unapproachable under severe stress. &nbsp;If
		your cat does not pass the &ldquo;temperament test&rdquo;, he/she will
		be put down immediately!</p>
	<p>
		When Guardian Angel takes in a owner give up we will try to help make
		the move as easy as possible, but it is not easy to find a foster that
		is not already over loaded, but we do our best to help them feel safe
		until they can find their new family. &nbsp;We have had owner give up
		cats die, even under 24 hour vet care, they stop eating and go into a
		deep depression and their bodies shut down, they give up. &nbsp;We
		call it the <em>&ldquo;Broken Heart Syndrome</em>.&rdquo;

		<span><strong>Another Option</strong>:&nbsp;Work with several
			rescue groups, and foster your baby until he/she can be placed.
			&nbsp;This cuts back the stress level, if they go from one family
			straight to another family. &nbsp;Rescues will post your kittyâ€™s
			picture and story, screen potential owners and will try to match up
			your kitty with a loving and caring forever home. &nbsp;The more
			rescues groups you can get to post your cat - the better chance you
			have of placing him/her quicker.</span>

	<p class="question">Did you know?</p>

	<ul>
		<li>In a 6-year period, one female cat and its young can produce
			360,000 kittens and one female dog and its offspring can be the
			source of 67,000 puppies.</li>

		<li style="text-align: left;">75,000 puppies and kittens are born
			everyday.</li>

		<li style="text-align: left;">The estimated amount of animals
			euthanized each year is 12,000,000.</li>

		<li style="text-align: left;">An altered pet will live a longer
			and healthier life.</li>

		<li style="text-align: left;">A neutered male has less chance of
			developing prostate cancer.</li>

		<li style="text-align: left;">Each year between 8 and 12 million
			dogs and cats end up in animal shelters because of overpopulation.</li>

		<li style="text-align: left;">By adopting a rescued animal and by
			altering your pet, you can help bring down these numbers
			significantly.&nbsp;</li>
