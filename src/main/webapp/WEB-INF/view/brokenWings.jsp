	<a href="<c:url value='/app/pet/13007319'/>">Bubbles</a> is a 10 year
	old beautiful female kitty. She is a special needs kitty because she
	has feline aids. She was rescued from another shelter: at that time,
	she had a very bad infection in her eye that would not clear up, so the
	vet thought it best to remove the eye. She is doing great and looking
	for a home to call her own. She must go with no other cats or another
	feline aids positive kitty.

				beautiful little boy came from a small town up north and he was an
				outdoor kitty. Sebastian's fur was so matted he was actually in pain
				from the mats, you could not pet him without him screaming in pain.
				As you can see now he is mat free and a very happy boy. <a

				target="_blank">Sebastian</a> did test positive for feline aids. He
				is the sweetest cat and is fine with other cats and dogs. He is very
				laid back. He needs to find a family that has another FIV cat or be
				the only cat. Are you that family?
