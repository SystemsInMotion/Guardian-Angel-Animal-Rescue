		<a href="/app/pet/13007319">Bubbles</a> is a 10 year
		old beautiful female kitty. She is a special needs kitty because she
		has feline aids. She was rescued from another shelter: at that time,
		she had a very bad infection in her eye that would not clear up, so
		the vet thought it best to remove the eye. She is doing great and
		looking for a home to call her own. She must go with no other cats or
		another feline aids positive kitty.
