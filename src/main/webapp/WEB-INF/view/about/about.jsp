		<h3>Who We Are</h3>

		<img src="<c:url value='/images/about_who_we_are.jpg'/>"
			class="inline-right shadow">
		<p>Guardian Angel Animal Rescue is a registered Michigan 501(c)(3)
			not-for-profit, no-kill rescue.</p>
		<p>
			We are a team of volunteers dedicated to saving animals from the
			streets, shelters, and dangerous situations. We take in animals that
			have been given up on, tortured, and often&nbsp;left to die.&nbsp; <strong>Guardian
				Angel Animal Rescue (GAAR) has no formal shelter</strong>. Instead,
			we&nbsp;accept surrendered, abandoned, and/or abused animals into our
			homes and care for them until a responsible, loving, permanent home
			is found. Needless to say, there are some instances when all foster
			homes are full, and GAAR pays for animals to be professionally
			kenneled until there is an opening in a foster home. &nbsp;We are
			always looking for more foster parents and other support volunteers
			to join our mission.
