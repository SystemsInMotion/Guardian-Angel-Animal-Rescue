		<h3>Be a foster dad or mom</h3>
		<hr>

		<p>It's the most rewarding way of helping. All you need to do is
			open your heart and provide a ton of TLC and sometimes a bit of
			patience to our pets to help them get over the trauma of their
			individual situation.</p>

		<p>It's also the hardest way of helping. It is hard giving up an
			animal that has been under your care for any amount of time. The
			love, time and care that goes into these animals makes it very
			difficult to give them up when they get adopted.&nbsp; A foster must
			understand that the only way to save and keep saving animals lives is
			to let go when the time arrives.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Foster homes are always needed. Vet care is provided by GAAR.
			If you are interested in fostering an animal, please call us.</p>

		<p>If you love animals as much as we do and you want to make a
			change and get involved, but you are worried about time or other
			constraints - don't hesitate to talk to us! We'll happily help figure
			out how you could help and if this is the right time for you to get
			involved.</p>

		<h3>The First Step to Fostering a Cat</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>
			<strong>A commitment to fostering a cat/kitten is both fun
				and rewarding. &nbsp;Here are some items that new volunteers should
				consider before fostering.</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>GAAR does not own a facility or shelter of our own.
				&nbsp;The foster home is an important stepping stone from the time
				the cat/kitten is rescued until he/she can be permanently adopted.</em>
		</p>

		<p>Before you decide to become a foster provider, it's a good idea
			to take stock of your situation and decide if fostering a cat is
			right for you.&nbsp; It can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience,
			and may be an ideal situation for families that are unable to make a
			long-term commitment to a pet cat. It helps if the whole family is
			dedicated to the process of fostering a cat, because each cat might
			be with you for several months. If you have a cat of your own, its
			vaccinations must be up to date. &nbsp;It may also be wise to
			quarantine incoming foster pets until their health can be adequately
			assessed and they can be tested for diseases like feline leukemia.
			&nbsp;Usually, we'd expect you to "donate" the food and kitty litter
			used by the foster cat. We will reimburse you for the cost of any
			veterinary care that is needed.</p>

		<p>Keep in mind that the cats coming to you may have been in a
			shelter or abandoned. &nbsp;These cats may be frightened, stressed,
			or poorly nourished and will need love and attention to help them
			become socialized. Some may need to be re-trained in using a litter
			pan or be coaxed to eat. You may need to administer medicine, or care
			for an older, special needs cat with diminished eyesight or
			hearing.</p>

		<p>In some cases, you can volunteer your foster home to take care
			of a mother cat with a litter of kittens. For the first month of the
			kittens' life, the mom will do most of the work, nursing and grooming
			her offspring. Kittens can generally be weaned at four to six weeks,
			and separated from their mother by the age of four weeks.</p>

		<p>One of our challenges is taking in unweaned or orphaned
			kittens. Newborn kittens fragile and vulnerable and they'll be
			depending on you to take the place of their missing mother. For the
			first two weeks of life, before kittens even open their eyes, they
			are completely helpless. These responsibilities include keeping the
			kittens very warm and feeding them every two to three hours with a
			syringe and commercial kitten formula. Momma cats stimulate the
			bodily functions of elimination in their kittens by licking the anus
			and urinary tract opening: you'll have to replicate this function
			with a warm, wet terrycloth washcloth.</p>

		<p>Last but not least, fostering any cat comes with the risk that
			you'll become attached to your foster and will feel sadness or a
			sense of loss when it's time to let them go. As each one is adopted
			out, it's key to remember that you provided a safe haven to a
			homeless cat that is now going on to a safe and permanent home.</p>

		<p>If you're interested in becoming a cat foster home, please
			contact us! We will gladly talk with you. &nbsp;Our process includes
			an application, an interview (in person or on the phone), and lastly,
			a home visit required at the time of the drop off of your first
			foster kitty!</p>
